## Disclaimer
This is a simple example application meant to be used as a discussion starter. Many shortcuts have been taken, and the code is heavily biased.
* Tests are entirely missing
* Application state is over-simplified
* Integration layers are missing
* Styling is simplified and unstructured

To use as a conversation starter, this application includes:
* A simple combined redux store with two stores and a combined reducer
* Translations support
* Simple routing
* Component(s) and page(s)
* React bootstrap

These are included superficially to prove an understanding of basic react concepts, but are not to be considered complete or according to best practices. 

**Do not use in production.**
